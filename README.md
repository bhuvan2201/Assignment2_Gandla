###### Volley Ball
Volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are separated by a net. Each team tries to score points by grounding a ball on the other team's court under organized rules. It has been a part of the official program of the Summer Olympic Games since **Tokyo** 1964. Beach volleyball was introduced to the programme at the **Atlanta** 1996 Summer Olympics. The adapted version of volleyball at the Summer Paralympic Games is sitting volleyball.
